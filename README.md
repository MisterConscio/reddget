# Reddget

This is a simple project based on one of my shell scripts, where it's goal is to fetch images from subreddits
and then display them in an image gallery, with the feature to preview the image.

This project is based on **React** + **Vite** and it strives to have a very basic and minimal interface.

## Setup

```shell
npm install
```

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Build

```shell
npm run build
```
